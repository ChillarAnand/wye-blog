PythonExpress brings tutors, organizations and students together
to spread the love of Python far and wide.

PythonExpress is an initiative and ongoing effort by the Python Software Society of India (PSSI). It aims to create an avenue for learning and exploring the Python programming language and community by acting as a bridge between organizations interested in hosting a workshop, students who want to learn, and experienced Python programmers who are interested to teach.
